# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This C++ program was create to calculate and display a year-end balance, as well as interests earned for an investment account over a certain amount of years. It displays both with and without additional monthly deposits. The issue that this program resolves is helping users understand how their investment grows over time, with their consistent monthly contributions and without them. This can assist in financial planning and decision-making for ones future.

# What did you do particularly well?
  The user interaction went well. The program provides clear prompts for user inputs, and displays results in an easy to read manner.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  In my opinion, the use of error handling would have a better enhancement to this program. Checking for valid numerical inputs and handling exceptions would prevent the program from crashing on an invalid input.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Making is sure that the calculation on  the monthly and yearly interest was achieved accurately. To overcome this, I broke down the problem into smaller parts. Calculating the monthly interest, updating the balance, and summing the interest for the year. I utilized nested loops to iterate over months within years to ensure correct amount. By using a debugger, I was able to step through the code and verify the calculations and formatting.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  It would definitely be breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable functions. This can be applied to any project. Attempting to take any task as a whole is a recipe for disaster. Its much wiser to go bit by bit and make sure that there is no room for error at the end.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
There are 3 main keys that were done:
1. The program is broken into small, single-responsibility functions. This made the code easier to read, test, and maintain.
2. Using clear and consistent names for variables and functions. This helps in understanding the codeâ€™s purpose without the need of extensive comments.
3. Adding comments. This helps to explain difficult logic, and the purpose of functions betters readability. This practice is essential for all projects, no matter the size.
